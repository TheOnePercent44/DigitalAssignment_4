<h2>Unfinished</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
You are the only kitten to have escaped the dark dungeon (see Lost Kittens for details). Swear revenge on the man responsible for the deaths of your friends and family!
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Heart-racing combat and puzzling platforming
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Meant to be a fast paced and exciting 2D platformer/fighter
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Arrow Keys to move. That's about it at the moment
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
I was just hoping to get something animated this week. I barely got the walking jumping and idle animations in.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
None. I was buried under too many other projects this week. My goal was to maybe get an animated cat together to use in a future prototype. Didn't even have time for that. Not realistically.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
You survived the dark dungeon of despair only to find your friends lost to it. Seek vengeance on the man who trapped you all in there!
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
You belong to a band of cats who are traveling, but you have become scattered and lost in a dungeon. You tried to find your friends but to no avail. Now you seek to strike down the one responsible for your torment and the death of your many cat friends.

3-5 minutes/level were it finished
